# Data_Science_Demos
Demo data science products which could be develop to info decision making 


This github site was created to illustrate some of the statistical products I can deploy in your business environment to turn data into a infomative commodity that will add value to your business.

The R-markdown docs and links to Shiny Apps have been develop so show case my methods and approaches to solving business problems and how the products will not be simple snap shots in time but will be reboost enough to provide value now and into the future. That is they will be well documented, reproducible and if appropriate can be handed over to stakeholders so new data can incorporated and outputs can be refreshed and kept up-to-date.
