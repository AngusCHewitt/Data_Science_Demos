# Data_Science_Demos

This github site was created to illustrate some of the statistical products I can deploy in your business environment to turn data into an informative commodity for your business.  

The R-markdown docs and Shiny Apps have been developed to showcase my methods and approaches to solving business problems. They will be examples of how complexity data science toolkits could only be a few clicks away using a Shiny App or an R-Markdown report which will provide comprehensive analysis of your business problem.

Demo 1: Within the R-Moarkdown folder you can find the html file titled "Data-Science-Case-Study" which runs through a hypothetical business case which involves using multivariant techniques and cluster models to cluster customers into meaningful cohorts. 

A Shiny app will also be added to the R-Shiny Folder which is part of the purposed analytics toolkits to help the client attach meaningful labels to customer records into the future (currently be developed & should be added to the folder soon).
